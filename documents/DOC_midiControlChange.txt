Purpose	MIDI CC
Description
  	  	 
MIDI CC 0 	Bank Select 	Allows user to switch bank for patch selection. Program change used with Bank Select. MIDI can access 16,384 patches per MIDI channel.
MIDI CC 1 	Modulation 	Generally this CC controls a vibrato effect (pitch, loudness, brighness). What is modulated is based on the patch.
MIDI CC 2 	Breath Controller 	Often times associated with aftertouch messages. It was originally intended for use with a breath MIDI controller in which blowing harder produced higher MIDI control values. It can be used for modulation as well.
MIDI CC 3 	Undefined 	 
MIDI CC 4 	Foot Controller 	Often used with aftertouch messages. It can send a continuous stream of values based on how the pedal is used.
MIDI CC 5 	Portamento Time 	Controls portamento rate to slide between 2 notes played subsequently.
MIDI CC 6 	Data Entry Most Significant Bit(MSB) 	Controls Value for NRPN or RPN parameters.
MIDI CC 7 	Volume 	Control the volume of the channel
MIDI CC 8 	Balance 	Controls the left and right balance, generally for stereo patches. 0 = hard left, 64 = center, 127 = hard right
MIDI CC 9 	Undefined 	 
MIDI CC 10 	Pan 	Controls the left and right balance, generally for mono patches. 0 = hard left, 64 = center, 127 = hard right
MIDI CC 11 	Expression 	Expression is a percentage of volume (CC7).
MIDI CC 12 	Effect Controller 1 	Usually used to control a parameter of an effect within the synth/workstation.
MIDI CC 13 	Effect Controller 2 	Usually used to control a parameter of an effect within the synth/workstation.
MIDI CC 14 	Undefined 	 
MIDI CC 15 	Undefined 	  
MIDI CC 16 – 19 	General Purpose 	 
MIDI CC 20 – 31 	Undefined 	 
MIDI CC 32 – 63 	Controller 0-31 Least Significant Bit (LSB) 	 
MIDI CC 64 	Damper Pedal / Sustain Pedal 	On/Off switch that controls sustain. (See also Sostenuto CC 66) 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
MIDI CC 65 	Portamento On/Off Switch 	On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
* MIDI CC 66 	Sostenuto On/Off Switch 	On/Off switch – Like the Sustain controller (CC 64), However it only holds notes that were “On” when the pedal was pressed. People use it to “hold” chords” and play melodies over the held chord. 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
MIDI CC 67 	Soft Pedal On/Off Switch 	On/Off switch - Lowers the volume of notes played. 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
MIDI CC 68 	Legato FootSwitch 	On/Off switch - Turns Legato effect between 2 subsequent notes On or Off. 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
MIDI CC 69 	Hold 2 	Another way to “hold notes” (see MIDI CC 64 and MIDI CC 66). However notes fade out according to their release parameter rather than when the pedal is released.
MIDI CC 70 	Sound Controller 1 	Usually controls the way a sound is produced. Default = Sound Variation.
MIDI CC 71 	Sound Controller 2 	Allows shaping the Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF). Default = Resonance - also(Timbre or Harmonics)
MIDI CC 72 	Sound Controller 3 	Controls release time of the Voltage controlled Amplifier (VCA). Default = Release Time.
MIDI CC 73 	Sound Controller 4 	Controls the “Attack’ of a sound. The attack is the amount of time it takes forthe sound to reach maximum amplitude.
MIDI CC 74 	Sound Controller 5 	Controls VCFs cutoff frequency of the filter.
MIDI CC 75 	Sound Controller 6 	Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave their sounds.
MIDI CC 76 	Sound Controller 7 	Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave their sounds.
MIDI CC 77 	Sound Controller 8 	Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave their sounds.
MIDI CC 78 	Sound Controller 9 	Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave their sounds.
MIDI CC 79 	Sound Controller 10 	Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave their sounds.

* MIDI CC 81 	General Purpose MIDI CC Controller 	Generic On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
* MIDI CC 82 	General Purpose MIDI CC Controller 	Generic On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On 
* MIDI CC 83 	General Purpose MIDI CC Controller 	Generic On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
MIDI CC 84 	Portamento CC Control 	Controls the amount of Portamento.
MIDI CC 85 – 90 	Undefined 	 
MIDI CC 91 	Effect 1 Depth 	Usually controls reverb send amount
MIDI CC 92 	Effect 2 Depth 	Usually controls tremolo amount
MIDI CC 93 	Effect 3 Depth 	Usually controls chorus amount
MIDI CC 94 	Effect 4 Depth 	Usually controls detune amount
MIDI CC 95 	Effect 5 Depth 	Usually controls phaser amount
MIDI CC 96 	(+1) Data Increment 	Usually used to increment data for RPN and NRPN messages.
MIDI CC 97 	(-1) Data Decrement 	Usually used to decrement data for RPN and NRPN messages.
MIDI CC 98 	Non-Registered Parameter Number LSB (NRPN) 	For controllers 6, 38, 96, and 97, it selects the NRPN parameter.
MIDI CC 99 	Non-Registered Parameter Number MSB (NRPN) 	For controllers 6, 38, 96, and 97, it selects the NRPN parameter.
MIDI CC 100 	Registered Parameter Number LSB (RPN) 	For controllers 6, 38, 96, and 97, it selects the RPN parameter.
MIDI CC 101 	Registered Parameter Number MSB (RPN) 	For controllers 6, 38, 96, and 97, it selects the RPN parameter.
MIDI CC 102 – 119 	Undefined 	
MIDI CC 120 to 127 are “Channel Mode Messages.”
MIDI CC 120 	All Sound Off 	Mutes all sounding notes. It does so regardless of release time or sustain. (See MIDI CC 123)
MIDI CC 121 	Reset All Controllers 	It will reset all controllers to their default.
MIDI CC 122 	Local On/Off Switch 	Turns internal connection of a MIDI keyboard/workstation, etc. On or Off. If you use a computer, you will most likely want local control off to avoid notes being played twice. Once locally and twice whent the note is sent back from the computer to your keyboard.
MIDI CC 123 	All Notes Off 	Mutes all sounding notes. Release time will still be maintained, and notes held by sustain will not turn off until sustain pedal is depressed.
MIDI CC 124 	Omni Mode Off 	Sets to “Omni Off” mode.
MIDI CC 125 	Omni Mode On 	Sets to “Omni On” mode.
MIDI CC 126 	Mono Mode 	Sets device mode to Monophonic.
MIDI CC 127 	Poly Mode 	Sets device mode to Polyphonic.

Table 3a: Registered Parameter Numbers

To set or change the value of a Registered Parameter:

1. Send two Control Change messages using Control Numbers 101 (65H) and 100 (64H) to select the desired Registered Parameter Number, as per the following table.

2. To set the selected Registered Parameter to a specific value, send a Control Change messages to the Data Entry MSB controller (Control Number 6). If the selected Registered Parameter requires the LSB to be set, send another Control Change message to the Data Entry LSB controller (Control Number 38).

3. To make a relative adjustment to the selected Registered Parameter's current value, use the Data Increment or Data Decrement controllers (Control Numbers 96 and 97).
