GSi VB3 - Release notes
www.GenuineSoundware.com


April, 2014
- This is version 1.4 recompiled to be x64 VST for Windows. There's no difference with the 32 bit version except 
that the support files (VB3.ini, VB3.lic, VB3.fxp) are now stored in the System User's path.
This is to be intended as a temporary release until the next version is ready to be released to the public.
Only the VST instrument version is available. The FX variant is not available in VST x64.
Mac users please be patient, unfortunately programming on Mac requires more time.



June 21, 2010
- Version 1.4 released
- Added new Rotary Speaker simulation derived from the code for the upcoming VB3 version 2!
- Added option to choose the destination of MIDI CC# 64 (sustain, rotary switch or assignable)
- Added new item in the DAT (ini) file for the CC# of rotary brake for the "2 controllers" option
- When the organ preset octave isn't active, keys below the first C and above the last C play folded-back octaves
- When switching between organ presets something made the switching get slower over and over. Fixed.
- When switching between organ presets while playing, an audible crackle was produced. Fixed.
- Now the "Midi Learn" takes the correct Channel even when the Split is active.
- Now the Split function leaves the pedalboard available on its own separate channel
- The pedalboard tapering is now correct (sub-harmonics were missing on some notes)
- When the host saved a project, VB3 muted its sound and caused an audible click. Fixed. *
- * Now programs and banks are saved as "custom chunks"
- * Reorganized the .DAT file and renamed it to .INI and moved the .FXP .INI and .LIC file locations on Mac to the User Library

* These changes may cause an incompatibility with the data saved by the previous versions. Before updating, take note of your
previous setting and consider re-making your own presets if you ever made any. Also, Mac users might have to re-authorize the 
plugin after installing this update.

- Rotary speaker simualtor: improved control over rotors speeds; improved algorithm "Jazz 122";
- Keyclick: improved and optimized
- Percussion: added the missing high-pass filter that gives it more punch and enforces the attack
- Organ sound: the leakage factor, the whole balance between lows and highs and the background noise have been noticeably improved
- Functionality: no more need to recompute the internal wavetables when the plugin is set in standby by the host; improved the stereo widening algorithm
- Many other things have changed internally that can't be explained in few words, but your fine ears will be able to notice the difference with previous versions.
